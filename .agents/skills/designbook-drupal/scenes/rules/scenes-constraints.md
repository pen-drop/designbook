# Drupal Scene Constraints

## Main Content vs. Block — Drupal Vocabulary

The abstract screen-scene rule names one route-bearing **main content** (an Entity or a View) in
the page `content` slot, with everything else a **block**. In Drupal terms:

- A route-bearing main **Entity** is a content entity — typically a **node**.
- A route-bearing main **View** is a view **page display** (it owns a route).
- **Blocks** (beiwerk, no route) are: a view **block** (`views_block:*`), menus, local tabs, special
  widgets, `block_content` entities, and `block_plugin` blocks. The same view is main content as a
  page display and a block as a view block — its **display type** decides the role.

A listing of several contents is a view; the one exception is a listing rendered inside an entity
through an entity-reference field (the parent node renders its own referenced children).

## Image Node Format

> ⛔ **Image nodes use the duck-typed `image:` key referencing a config entity.**
> The `image` value MUST match a bundle name under `config.image_style` in `data-model.yml`.
> Ratio-based style names use the `ratio_` prefix (e.g. `ratio_16_9`) to avoid YAML numeric parsing issues.

```yaml
# ✅ Correct — image node with named style
- image: hero
  alt: "Modern architecture building"

# ✅ Correct — ratio-based style with ratio_ prefix
- image: ratio_16_9
  alt: "Landscape photo"

# ✅ Correct — image node with custom source (CSS aspect-ratio mode)
- image: card
  alt: "Team photo"
  src: "/images/team.jpg"

# ❌ Wrong — old format with type: image
- type: image
  image_style: hero
  alt: "Some image"

# ❌ Wrong — using component instead of image node
- component: "$COMPONENT_NAMESPACE:image"
  props:
    src: "https://picsum.photos/800/600"
```

## Entity Reference Format

> ⛔ **Entity references use a two-part `entity` string plus a separate `view_mode` key.**

```yaml
# ✅ Correct — entity is "entity_type.bundle", view_mode is a separate field
- entity: "[entity_type].[bundle]"
  view_mode: "full"
  record: 0

# ❌ Wrong — view_mode embedded in entity string causes double-dot path
- entity: "[entity_type].[bundle].full"
  record: 0
```

The renderer loads: `$DESIGNBOOK_DATA/entity-mapping/{entity_type}.{bundle}.{view_mode}.jsonata`

The `entity` string provides `entity_type` (part 0) and `bundle` (part 1). `view_mode` is read from its own key — if omitted, the path becomes `[entity_type].[bundle]..jsonata` (double dot, file not found).

`record:` is an optional integer (default: 0) — selects which record from `data.yml` to use.
