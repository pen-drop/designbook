# Blueprint: List View Mapping

Applies when `map-entity` runs for a View (`entity_type: view` — a `config.view` bundle).

## A view mapping is self-contained

A view scene node (`entity: "view.<id>"`, with no `record`/`select`) is resolved with an **empty
context**: the entity builder evaluates the view mapping against `{}`, not against a sample record.
So a view mapping MUST be **self-contained** — it enumerates the rows it lists directly and reads
nothing from `$`. A mapping that dereferences `$` (e.g. `$view.rows`, `$.items_per_page`) resolves
to empty and the listing renders blank.

The rows a view lists are the records of its **row bundle** — the content `entity_type`/`bundle`/
`view_mode` the view's `row` declares. The `design-screen` intake adds that row bundle to
`sample_data_bundles`, so its records exist; the mapping then references those records by index.
Because the rows are real row-bundle records, the entity-mapping validator finds them (no
"No sample records found") and the same enumeration renders the list.

## JSONata Pattern — flat list

Emit a flat array, one entry per listed row-bundle record. Top-level entries use the
`{ "type": "entity", … }` form (at the mapping's top level the validator accepts a `component` node
or a `type: "entity"` node; the `entity: "type.bundle"` string form is a scene-node shorthand, not a
mapping-output top-level form):

```jsonata
[
  { "type": "entity", "entity_type": "<row_entity_type>", "bundle": "<row_bundle>", "view_mode": "<row_view_mode>", "record": 0 },
  { "type": "entity", "entity_type": "<row_entity_type>", "bundle": "<row_bundle>", "view_mode": "<row_view_mode>", "record": 1 }
  /* one entry per row-bundle record the view lists */
]
```

Each entry renders the row bundle in its listed view-mode; the entity builder resolves each record.

## Optional wrapper (summary / pager)

When `list-view` / `view-summary` / `pager` components exist, wrap the same enumerated array in the
wrapper's `rows` slot — still self-contained (rows are enumerated, never read from `$`):

```jsonata
{
  "component": "$DESIGNBOOK_COMPONENT_NAMESPACE:list-view",
  "slots": {
    "rows": [
      { "type": "entity", "entity_type": "<row_entity_type>", "bundle": "<row_bundle>", "view_mode": "<row_view_mode>", "record": 0 },
      { "type": "entity", "entity_type": "<row_entity_type>", "bundle": "<row_bundle>", "view_mode": "<row_view_mode>", "record": 1 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## A View's Display Type Decides Its Role

The same view can be a page's main content or beiwerk beside it — its **display type** decides:

- A view **page display** owns a route and can be a screen's route-bearing main content.
- A view **block** (`views_block:*`) owns no route; it is a block that sits beside the main content.

A View that a screen renders as its main content is modelled as a `config.view.<id>` bundle (its own
`view_modes` entry) so the renderer resolves it; the Drupal config-object name `views.view.<id>`
stays the sync/export address.
