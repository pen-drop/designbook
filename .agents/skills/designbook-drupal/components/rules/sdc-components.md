# SDC Component Rules

Format and logic constraints for the three SDC artefacts. Build patterns and markup
templates live in [schemas.yml](../schemas.yml) and [blueprints/](../blueprints/).

## Global

### Naming

- Component directory + file basenames: **kebab-case** (`nav-main/nav-main.*`).
- **Slot keys and prop keys: snake_case**. Story field names and Twig variable references mirror these exactly — hyphens silently break Twig (`{{ main-content }}` parses as subtraction and falls back to empty).
- Filename matches directory name.
- Components visually descriptive, never domain-specific: `card` not `article-card`.

### group

`group:` required, one of: `Action`, `Data Display`, `Navigation`, `Layout`, `Shell`.

### Storybook story address

Freeze identity in the plan as `namespace` + `group` + `component` + `variant`. Derive every CSF story id and story URL from that identity.

The SDC Storybook addon builds:

```text
title = {namespace}/{group}/{name}
id    = sanitize(title)--sanitize(variant)
```

`sanitize` lowercases and turns spaces/underscores/other non-alphanumerics into `-` (CSF `toId`). Examples:

| namespace | group | component `name` / dir | variant | CSF story id |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `test_integration_drupal` | `Shell` | `Header` / `header` | `default` | `test-integration-drupal-shell-header--default` |
| `test_integration_drupal` | `Action` | `Button` / `button` | `primary` | `test-integration-drupal-action-button--primary` |
| `test_integration_drupal` | `Data Display` | `Icon` / `icon` | `default` | `test-integration-drupal-data-display-icon--default` |

`group: Shell` → segment `shell`. `group: Data Display` → segment `data-display`. The middle segment is always the declared `group`.

When `group` is absent, the addon falls back to title group `SDC` → segment `sdc`. That fallback applies only to retained existing stories that already lack `group` in the live index. Every new or rewritten component declares `group:` and therefore uses the group-derived segment above.

`refresh-components.story_ids` and every `validate` / capture story address for components written in this run use these derived ids. Retained fixture stories keep the exact id already present in the live index.

### File Set

Required artefacts per component, all kebab-case:

- `<name>.component.yml` — metadata + schema
- `<name>.twig` — markup, one file, all variants inline
- `<name>.<variant>.story.yml` — one file per variant. SDC itself does not require this, but designbook does: every component always ships at least `<name>.default.story.yml` so it has a Storybook entry and can be visually verified.

Co-located assets (auto-discovered — do **not** declare them in `.component.yml`):

- `<name>.css` — component-scoped styles (optional)
- `<name>.js` — the component's JavaScript. Co-located `<name>.js` is the **default, auto-discovered integration point for any component JS** — interaction, progressive enhancement, third-party widget wiring, whatever the component needs. Picked up by filename and active in Storybook — Drupal behaviors are attached after each render, both in the component's own story and in the designbook-generated scene and entity view-mode stories the component is placed into. The JS approach is not fixed: the `js-behavior` blueprint offers a `Drupal.behaviors` starting point, but a project may use another (Alpine, vanilla, …) — blueprints are overridable. Add it when the component needs scripting; omit when it doesn't.

`libraryDependencies` / `libraryOverrides` in `.component.yml` is only required when the component pulls in an **external** library (third-party widget like a slider, lightbox, chart) or extends another component's library. For plain co-located `<name>.css` / `<name>.js`, the SDC addon picks them up by filename — no YAML wiring.

### YAML Quoting

Always double quotes (`"`) in every YAML file. Single quotes break the SDC Storybook addon parser.

### Namespace Substitution

`DESIGNBOOK_COMPONENT_NAMESPACE` is a literal placeholder — replace with the resolved namespace value before writing the file.

## .component.yml

- `thirdPartySettings.sdcStorybook.disableBasicStory: true` mandatory on every component — disables auto-generated basic stories since explicit `.story.yml` files are always provided.
- `variants:` is the canonical source for variant definitions. Never declare `variant` under `props.properties` when `variants:` is already defined top-level.
- Empty `variants`, `props`, or `slots` are omitted entirely — never written as empty blocks.
- Same props + same slots, different markup → single component with variants.
- Different props or slots → separate components.
- Stories never live inside `.component.yml`.

## .twig

- **One root element** with `attributes.addClass`: `<div{{ attributes.addClass(['name']) }}>`. No fragments.
- **Filter the class array, not the `attributes` object.** A filter applied to the `addClass(...)` return value runs against the `Attribute` object and stringifies it to `[object map]`, emitting broken markup like `<header[object map]>` that breaks tag nesting. Filter the array *inside* the call.
  - ❌ `{{ attributes.addClass(['a', cond ? 'b'])|filter(c => c) }}` → `[object map]`
  - ✅ `{{ attributes.addClass(['a', cond ? 'b']|filter(c => c)) }}`
- **One `.twig` file per component**. Variants inline with `{% if variant == '…' %}` blocks. Never `<name>--<variant>.twig` — the SDC addon imports every `.twig` in the directory and partials collide.
- **Slot rendering conditional**: `{% if slot %}{{ slot }}{% endif %}`. No wrapper unless the surrounding markup requires it.
- **Layout components** (`container`, `section`, `grid`) wrap each slot in `{% block <slot> %}…{% endblock %}` for `{% embed %}` compatibility. Non-layout components do not.
- **No hardcoded colors** — use CSS custom properties from design tokens or utility classes derived from them.
- **CSS framework routing**: read `@designbook-css-$DESIGNBOOK_FRAMEWORK_CSS/SKILL.md` for class names. It is the single source of truth — do not invent class naming.
- **Slots over inline markup**: when markup contains other components or interactive elements (buttons, links, icons), use slots — never inline component markup that could be a slot.

## .story.yml

- **One file per variant**: `<name>.<variant>.story.yml`. Default story is `<name>.default.story.yml`. The name segment is mandatory — never `<name>.story.yml`.
- **Flat format** — top-level keys are `component`, `name`, `props`, `slots`. Select a declared variant through `props.variant`; a top-level `variant` is ignored by the Storybook SDC loader. No `stories:` wrapper.
- **One story per file** — never combine multiple stories using `---` YAML document separators.
- **Story node `type:`** ∈ `element`, `component`, `image`.
- **Placeholder images** use service URLs (`https://placehold.co/600x400`). Local file paths are not served by Storybook.
- **Component refs include provider prefix**: `<namespace>:<name>`. The provider maps to a Twig namespace configured in `.storybook/main.js` → `sdcStorybookOptions.namespaces`. Without it, the SDC addon cannot resolve the component path.
- **Visually distinct states** — every story file must show a meaningful visual difference. Stories that look identical (differ only in invisible props) are not allowed.
