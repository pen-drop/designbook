# Twig `embed … only` Drops Slot Variables — Forward Them Explicitly

A component that wraps its content in `{% embed 'namespace:container' … only %}`
uses the `only` keyword to cut the embedded template off from the parent's
variables. A bare `{{ my_slot }}` referenced **inside** the embed body then
resolves to empty even though the slot was actually passed into the wrapping
component — no Twig error, the markup just renders without that slot's content.

Symptom: the component renders its shell and wrapper elements, but one or more
slot blocks inside an `embed … only` are empty.

## The fix — forward the slot variables into the embed

```twig
{% embed 'namespace:container' with { max_width: 'xl', logo: logo, search: search,
                                       navigation: navigation, actions: actions } only %}
  {% block content %}
    <div class="header__logo">{{ logo }}</div>
    <div class="header__nav-end">{{ search }}{{ navigation }}{{ actions }}</div>
  {% endblock %}
{% endembed %}
```

Slots are exposed as top-level component variables — a bare `{{ my_slot }}` at
the component's **top level** (outside any embed) already works without
forwarding. Only the `only`-embed boundary drops them, because `only` intentionally
scopes the embedded template to just what `with { … }` explicitly supplies.

A `{% block name %}{{ name }}{% endblock %}` nested inside an embed, relying on
the variable still being in scope, is unreliable — the explicit
`with { name: name }` forward at the embed call site is the deterministic fix.

For genuinely fixed content that should always render regardless of what a
caller passes (a required brand mark, a footer credit line), render it
**internally** in the component's own Twig — overridable via its slot — rather
than depending on every caller to remember to forward it through an embed
boundary.

## Checks

| ID | Severity | What to verify | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| SLOT-01 | error | Slot variables referenced inside `{% embed … only %}` are forwarded via `with { slot: slot }` at the embed call site | component twig |
| SLOT-02 | warning | Fixed/always-present content that should not depend on caller forwarding is rendered internally in the component's own Twig, not solely through an embed-forwarded slot | component twig |
