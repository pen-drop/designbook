# Blueprint: Component JS Behavior

The **default** starting point for the JavaScript of a component that has interaction
(a `behavior` on its `interactive[]` entry): a toggle/disclosure/overlay/menu that
opens, closes, or activates a target. This is one approach — `<name>.js` holds any
component JS, and a project may script it differently (Alpine, vanilla, a web
component); as a blueprint this is overridable. The Drupal route is the default
because it runs unchanged in Drupal and Storybook — the SDC Storybook addon ships the
Drupal JS runtime and auto-discovers `<name>.js`, and `Drupal.attachBehaviors` runs
after each render — both in the component's own story and in the designbook-generated
scene and entity view-mode stories the component is placed into — so a `Drupal.behaviors`
toggle stays live wherever the component appears, without extra wiring.

## Pattern

Attach with `Drupal.behaviors` + `once()` so re-attaches (and Storybook re-renders)
don't double-bind. Drive an accessible attribute, not a CSS class, as the source of
truth for the open state, and reflect it on the controlled target:

```js
(function (Drupal, once) {
  Drupal.behaviors.<name> = {
    attach(context) {
      once('<name>', '[data-behavior="<name>"]', context).forEach((trigger) => {
        const target = document.querySelector(trigger.getAttribute('aria-controls'));
        trigger.addEventListener('click', () => {
          const open = trigger.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';
          trigger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', String(!open));
          if (target) target.hidden = open;
        });
      });
    },
  };
})(Drupal, once);
```

The markup side: the trigger carries `aria-controls="<target-id>"`, `aria-expanded`
(initial `"false"`), and a stable `data-behavior` hook; the target carries the id and
starts `hidden`. Responsive visibility (which breakpoint shows the trigger vs. the
inline element) stays in CSS utilities — only the open/closed toggle is JS.

## Native alternative

For a plain show/hide of static content with no overlay or focus semantics (e.g. a
footer column that collapses on small viewports), `<details>/<summary>` is a
no-JS option. Anything with an overlay, focus trap, or off-canvas surface uses the
JS pattern above.
