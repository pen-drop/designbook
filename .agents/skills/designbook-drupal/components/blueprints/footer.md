# Blueprint: Footer

Site footer that composes brand area, navigation, and copyright.

**Use for:** The page footer region.

## Structure

- Wraps its content in a `container` component for consistent edge spacing and max-width
- Contains a `navigation` component (variant: footer) as a required slot

## Props
- copyright: string (optional)

## Slots
- navigation — footer navigation component (required)
- Additional slots as determined by the design reference

## Multi-Section Structure

Footers often consist of multiple distinct visual sections, each with its own background color. Each section wraps its content in a `container` embed to maintain consistent edge spacing. The outer section `<div>` carries its own background color and optional border.

The number of sections, their background colors, slots, and content are determined by the design reference — not prescribed here.
