# Blueprint: Static Assets

Describes how static assets (logos, icons, SVGs, favicons) from the design reference are downloaded and referenced in components and scenes.

## Storage Location

Place assets in the Storybook `public/` directory. Storybook serves this directory automatically at the root path — no `staticDirs` configuration needed.

```
public/
  logo.svg
  logo-secondary.png
  favicon.ico
```

These are then available at `/logo.svg`, `/logo-secondary.png`, etc.

## When to Download

During **intake** and **create-scene**, identify visual assets from the design reference that are not decorative CSS (gradients, borders, shadows). Download these assets before writing scene YAML or component templates.

Assets to download:
- Brand logos (site logo, partner logos, institutional marks)
- SVG icons used in navigation or UI elements (see Icons section below)
- Static images that are part of the shell (not content images)

Assets to skip:
- Content images (use placeholder service or `src` field in data.yml)
- Icons from icon fonts (FontAwesome, Material Icons, etc.)
- CSS-only decorations (gradients, borders, box-shadows)

## Icons

SVG icons require special handling — projects often use build plugins (SVG sprites, icon loaders) that expect icons in a specific directory.

**Before placing icon SVGs**, scan the project's build config to determine the icon pipeline:

1. Read `vite.config.*` or `webpack.config.*` for SVG-related plugins (e.g. `vite-plugin-svg-sprite`, `svg-sprite-loader`, `vite-svg-loader`, `svgr`)
2. If a plugin is found, determine its source directory (e.g. `src/icons/`, `assets/icons/`) and place icons there
3. If no SVG plugin is configured, fall back to `public/` like other static assets

```bash
# Example: vite-plugin-svg-sprite configured with src/icons/
curl -sL "<url>" -o "src/icons/<icon-name>.svg"

# No SVG plugin found — use public/
curl -sL "<url>" -o "public/<icon-name>.svg"
```

## How to Download

Use Playwright to extract asset URLs from the reference site, then download via `curl`:

```bash
# Extract image src from a specific element
npx playwright eval '<selector>' 'el => el.src || el.querySelector("img")?.src'

# For inline SVGs, extract the markup directly
npx playwright eval '<selector>' 'el => el.outerHTML'

# Download to public/
curl -sL "<url>" -o "public/<filename>"
```

For inline SVGs that are embedded directly in the page HTML, extract the SVG markup and write it to a `.svg` file rather than downloading.

## Referencing in Scenes

Assets in `public/` are served at the root path:

```yaml
slots:
  logo: '<img src="/logo.svg" alt="Site Logo" style="height:47px;width:auto;">'
```

## Referencing in Templates

How component templates reference static assets depends on the framework integration. The integration skill (e.g. `designbook-drupal`) may provide its own conventions for asset path resolution in templates.
