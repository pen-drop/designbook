# Icon Sprite Rendering

A design system that renders icons through a shared icon component backed by a
generated SVG sprite gets that rendering consistent, cacheable, and colorable via
`currentColor`. Every icon consumption goes through that shared component — never
a hand-written inline `<svg><use>`.

## Consumption — always the shared icon component

Render an icon by including the shared icon component, never by hand-writing a
`<svg><use href=…>` inline in a component's own markup:

- The icon identifier is the sprite symbol id (typically the source filename).
- Size is expressed through a token from the component's own sizing scale, never a
  hand-written width/height utility pair. An unconstrained size on an `<svg>` inside a
  flex or grid ancestor can blow past its intended box — pick the token instead of
  hand-sizing.
- Color follows `currentColor`; set it on an ancestor via a text-color utility or
  token rather than styling the `<svg>` fill directly.
- Extra styling passes through the component's own class-merge mechanism, not
  ad hoc markup on the `<svg>`.

The shared icon component's own template is the only place a raw
`<use href="…">` reference may appear.

## Generation — a build step, not a hand-maintained file

The sprite is assembled at build time from individual tracked SVG source files (one
file per symbol); the assembled sprite itself is a generated artifact:

- **Source of truth:** the tracked per-symbol SVG files. Add or edit an icon there.
- **Generated output:** the sprite file. Do not hand-edit it — any manual edit is
  overwritten by the next build. It MAY be gitignored as a build artifact; when it
  is, a fresh checkout has no sprite until the first build runs.
- **Serving:** the dev/build/preview server MUST serve the generated sprite at the
  exact URL the icon component references it by. A static-file configuration gap
  here is a common, silent failure: the icon `<svg>` renders at its sized
  dimensions but shows nothing, because the `<use href>` target 404s — no console
  error, no visibly broken markup, just an empty box.
  **Verify after any icon work:** fetch the sprite URL directly and confirm a 200
  response, not a 404.

### Adding or changing an icon

1. Add or edit the per-symbol source SVG file.
2. Run the build (or its watch mode) to regenerate the sprite.
3. Reference the new symbol id from the shared icon component.

Icon SVGs heavy with gradients or `<defs>` can have their ids collapsed or dropped
by SVG optimization during the build — verify the symbol actually survived in the
generated sprite after adding one.

## Checks

| ID | Severity | What to verify | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| ICON-01 | error | Icons render via the shared icon component, not a hand-written `<svg><use>` outside that component's own template | component markup |
| ICON-02 | error | The referenced icon id exists as a per-symbol source file the sprite build consumes | icon source directory |
| ICON-03 | warning | Icon size is set via a sizing-scale token, not a hand-written width/height utility pair; color resolves through `currentColor` set on an ancestor | component markup |
| ICON-04 | warning | New icons are added as source files, never by hand-editing the generated sprite | icon source directory |
| ICON-05 | error | The dev/build/preview server serves the generated sprite at 200, not 404, at the URL the icon component references | server static-file config |
