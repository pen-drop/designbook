# Screen Scene Constraints

Constraints specific to screen scenes (section pages).

## Rules

- **Shell inheritance** -- scene items MUST start with `scene: design-system:<shell_name>` (normally `scene: design-system:shell`) and fill the `content` slot via `with:`. The ref source is the literal `design-system` — the location of the shell scenes file — **NOT** the shell SceneFile's `id:` (`debo-design-system`). Using the `id` as the source (`debo-design-system:shell`) fails to resolve and the screen renders empty.
- **Entity nodes allowed** -- use `entity:` with `view_mode:` for data-driven content
- **`group:`** must be `"Designbook/Sections/{{ section_title }}"`
- **`id:`** must match `{{ section_id }}`
- ⛔ **Scene `name:` must NOT be `overview`** (case-insensitive). `overview` is reserved: every scenes file already exports an `overview` story (the section overview/management page). A scene named `overview` produces a second `export const overview` in the same module, collides with the reserved one, and silently renders the section page instead of the scene. Name scenes meaningfully — by the section or screen purpose (e.g. the `{{ section_id }}` or `default`) — **never** the screen *type* word `overview`. (Enforced by the `scene` validator.)

## Output Structure

```yaml
id: {{ section_id }}
title: {{ section_title }}
description: {{ section_description }}
status: planned
order: [number]

group: "Designbook/Sections/{{ section_title }}"
scenes:
  - name: "[screen-name — meaningful, NOT 'overview'; e.g. the section id or 'default']"
    items:
      - scene: "design-system:shell"
        with:
          content:
            - entity: "[ENTITY_TYPE].[ENTITY_BUNDLE]"
              view_mode: "[VIEW_MODE]"
            - component: "$DESIGNBOOK_COMPONENT_NAMESPACE:some-component"
              slots: ...
```
