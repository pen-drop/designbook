# Typed Component Boundary

A component varies only through named typed props or declared variants — never through
an open-ended prop that hands a caller raw styling material to fill in. A caller selects
*what* the component is (a variant) or supplies *typed values* (a size enum, a color
token, a boolean flag); it never supplies *how* the component looks by injecting a class
string, style string, or similar free-form styling payload.

## Permitted: Attribute/Class Merge at the Component's Own Root Element

A component may merge caller-supplied HTML attributes (including a `class` attribute)
onto **its own root element**, for the caller's own integration needs (test hooks,
layout-context spacing utilities applied by the parent that owns that spacing decision).
This is attribute passthrough at the boundary the component itself controls — the
component's internal structure and its own variation are untouched by what comes through.

## Forbidden: An Open `class`/`classes` Prop the Caller Fills In

A component must not declare a `class` or `classes` prop in its own schema as the
mechanism through which a caller selects the component's appearance. If a caller can put
arbitrary layout, color, size, or spacing classes into that prop and have the component
render differently as a result, the prop has become an undeclared, untyped variant
channel — every distinct value is an undocumented variant the component's schema never
enumerates.

**Wrong** (open prop used to steer the component's own appearance):

```yaml
props:
  properties:
    classes:
      type: string
      description: Additional classes for color and spacing
```

```
{{ classes }}  <!-- caller decides: bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2, or bg-red-500 px-8 py-1, ... -->
```

**Correct** (typed props / declared variants for anything the component varies by):

```yaml
props:
  properties:
    size:
      type: string
      enum: [sm, md, lg]
    tone:
      type: string
      enum: [neutral, accent]
variants: [default, compact]
```

## Checks

| ID | Severity | What to verify | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| TYPED-01 | error | A component's `props`/`props.properties` does not declare a `class` or `classes` property used to inject layout classes (spacing, positioning, grid/flex placement) that a caller fills in to change the component's own layout | body |
| TYPED-02 | error | A component's `props`/`props.properties` does not declare a `class` or `classes` property used to inject color, size, or padding variation that a caller fills in to steer the component's appearance | body |
| TYPED-03 | error | A component's `props`/`props.properties` does not declare a new open `class`/`classes` prop as a general styling escape hatch; appearance variation is expressed via named typed props or `variants:` instead | body |
