# Referenced Content Renders ONLY via Its Own View Mode

Reinforces [entity-reference-rendering.md](entity-reference-rendering.md): a parent
must never reach through an entity/record reference and render the child's fields
(title, image, link, text) inside its own or a bespoke item markup. Every resolved
reference is rendered by the **referenced bundle's own view mode**, and the parent
only supplies the **slot** where that rendered output lands.

## The rule

1. **Emit one referenced-entity render node per item**, placed into a parent slot.
   The mapping/rendering engine resolves the referenced bundle's own
   entity-mapping/view-mode and self-renders the child; the parent's own mapping
   never reads the child's field values.

2. **No bespoke per-item component exists solely to render a referenced child's
   fields.** A component whose entire purpose is repeating a referenced child's
   title/image/link inside a parent-owned wrapper is the anti-pattern this rule
   removes. That markup belongs to the **referenced bundle's own view-mode
   component + mapping**, not a sibling component the parent inlines.

3. **Different markup for the same reference → a dedicated view mode, still
   entity-rendered.** When a reference needs to render differently from an
   existing view mode, do not hand-roll the alternate markup in the parent.
   Add the new view-mode display and its own entity-mapping to the appropriate
   component, and reference it by name. The parent still only renders the slot.

4. **Reuse an existing shared view-mode component** for any reference that already
   has a suitable rendering; introduce a new view-mode component only when the
   markup is genuinely distinct from what already exists.

5. **This applies to any referenceable child**, not just top-level content
   entities — a referenced sub-record (paragraph, block, fragment) is rendered the
   same way: through its own bundle's view-mode render node, with the parent
   (tab strip, grid, carousel chrome) supplying only the slot.

6. **Sample data for a referenced-entity render node lives in that bundle's own
   sample-data record**, keyed for lookup by the rendering engine — never inlined
   into the parent's sample-data record as embedded child field values.

## Checks

| ID | Severity | What to verify | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| RVM-01 | error | A multi-value entity/record reference renders each child as its own render node in a slot — the parent does not render child fields itself | parent mapping + markup |
| RVM-02 | error | No bespoke component exists solely to render a referenced child's fields; that markup lives in the referenced bundle's own view-mode component | components |
| RVM-03 | error | Distinct reference markup has its own dedicated view mode + entity-mapping; it is not hand-rolled in the parent | view-mode config + entity-mapping |
| RVM-04 | warning | A reference that already has a suitable shared view-mode component reuses it instead of introducing a new one | mapping |
| RVM-05 | warning | Referenced-entity sample data lives in that bundle's own sample-data record, not inlined in the parent's record | sample-data |
