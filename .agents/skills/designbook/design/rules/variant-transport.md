# Variant Transport

`variants:` in a component's definition is the **single declaration site** for a
component's variant set — the enumerated set of variant IDs a component supports.
No render path re-declares that set. Selecting *among* the declared variants happens
through exactly one channel per render path; a render path never carries two competing
variant-selection channels at once.

## Render-Path Matrix

| Render path | Selection channel | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Story file (`<component>.<variant>.story.yml`) | Top-level `variant` field | The story identity already encodes the variant in its filename; the top-level `variant` field is the single selection channel for that file. A `variant` key nested under `props` is a second, competing declaration and is forbidden. |
| Scene/mapping node (a scene, entity view-mode, or shell composition placing a component instance) | `props.variant` | The renderer forwards only a node's `props` to the component; a top-level `variant:` key on a scene/mapping node is silently ignored. `props.variant` is the correct — and only — selection channel here. |
| Backend-driven selection (`variant_id`) | The `variant_id` field of the backend's own component-selection mechanism | `variant_id` is a backend transport detail carrying an already-resolved variant choice into the render call. It does not create a second source of truth alongside `variants:`, and it is a different field name from both `variant` (story) and `props.variant` (scene node) — do not conflate the three. |

A component's `.component.yml` never declares a `variant` (or `*_variant`) property
under `props.properties` — that would create a second, competing declaration of the
variant set alongside `variants:`. This constraint is independent of the render-path
matrix above: it governs the component's own schema, not how a consumer selects among
the variants that schema declares.

## Checks

| ID | Severity | What to verify | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| VARIANT-01 | error | A `.component.yml`'s `props`/`props.properties` never declares a `variant` or `*_variant` property when `variants:` is populated | body |
| VARIANT-02 | error | A `.story.yml` file selects its variant via the top-level `variant` field, never via a `variant` key nested under `props` | body |
