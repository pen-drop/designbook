# Component Contract Index

A single cross-cutting index for the constraints that govern component work across
its full lifecycle — creation, variant stories, entity mapping, and review/polish.
Each detailed constraint remains owned by its own rule file; this index exists so
that inventory and review tooling can cite a stable ID instead of re-deriving the
constraint from prose each time.

| ID | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| CCI-01 | [Variant transport](variant-transport.md): display variants are declared at the top-level `variants:` and never re-declared as a `variant`/`*_variant` prop. |
| CCI-02 | [Typed component boundary](typed-component-boundary.md): a component varies only through named typed props or declared variants — never through an open-ended styling prop. |
| CCI-03 | [Presenter composition](presenter-composition.md): the smallest existing component is reused before new markup is introduced; presenters map data, branch, loop, and compose components — they do not own visible markup. |
| CCI-04 | [Entity reference rendering](entity-reference-rendering.md): referenced entities render as their own render node in a slot, never inlined as child field values. |

Each owning rule file's own `trigger`/`filter` governs when it loads; this index
adds no additional activation condition beyond citing the stable ID. A project's
CSS-framework integration adds its own styling-utility contract under its own
`rules/` — this index does not duplicate framework-specific styling constraints.

These constraints apply at component creation, variant-story creation, entity
mapping, component/screen work, and final polish/review alike. The detailed
owner files load at their own declared triggers; this index is the discoverability
boundary across that full set of stages.

## Checks

| ID | Severity | What to verify | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| CCI-05 | error | Every ID in this index's table links to a rule file that actually exists | design/rules |
| CCI-06 | warning | No contract listed here duplicates prose already owned by its linked rule file (this index only cites, it never re-states the constraint) | body |
