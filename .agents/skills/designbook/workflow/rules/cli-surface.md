# CLI command surface

`_debo` / `npx storybook-addon-designbook` is the command contract for every
workflow. Run the command. Its stdout and stderr are the spec: catalogue,
schemas, instructions, status. Skill descriptions only fire the skill; they
are not the command surface.

Every intake's first command is `workflow discover <id>`. Source dumps use
`_debo reference save --reference <dir> --url <url> --state <name> --session
<name>`. Screenshots use `_debo reference capture-image --reference <dir> --path
<png> --url <url> --selector <sel> --width <px> --session <name>` (optional
`--steps`, `--prelude`). Asset files use `_debo reference capture-file
--reference <dir> --path <rel> --url <absolute-http-url> --session <name>`.
Unpublished revisions are read with `_debo reference inspect`; a prelude is
fingerprinted with `_debo reference prelude`. A full matrix uses
`_debo capture matrix`. Story identity uses `_debo storybook check`.
`workflow instructions` supplies the saved step. A nonzero CLI exit ends this
work with that exact message. Recover with `--help`, the catalogue, or the
saved step instructions.

`packages/storybook-addon-designbook` is not a recovery path. When the work needs
a fact that `--help`, the catalogue and the saved step instructions do not carry,
stop and name that missing fact in the report — the skills own it, so the gap is
the finding. Reconstructing it from the addon source, or from a stored artifact
opened off disk, publishes a guess in the place of an observation.
