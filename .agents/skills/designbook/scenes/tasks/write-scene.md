# Write Scene

## Result: scene-file

Produce the complete SceneFile for the selected `scene_path` and `scene_name` from `section_scenes` plus the requested delta. A uniquely matching name replaces only the selected scene's requested content in its current array position. An absent name adds exactly one entry. Multiple matches or conflicting selectors block execution and require corrected intake.

Preserve sibling scenes and their order, unrelated selected-scene fields, and unrelated file metadata. Preserve the file and scene identities unless intake explicitly declared a rename and every reference edit. Repeating the same delta leaves one target entry and the same semantic result.

The target role is `scene_scope`, regardless of the originating workflow. Applicable rules use this parameter for screen, shell or standalone constraints. The existing file comes from intake or a declared `create-scene-file` predecessor for an absent file.

Completion: exactly one selected entry expresses the requested delta; all preserved content matches the baseline. Every necessary dependent edit and build/render check is already declared in the saved definition.
