# Tailwind Component Styling

Use Tailwind utility classes as the default styling surface for component output.

Prefer utilities generated from Designbook tokens:

- Standard Tailwind namespaces use token-backed utilities directly, such as `bg-primary`, `text-on-surface`, `font-heading`, and `rounded-pill`.
- Non-standard namespaces use arbitrary values that reference token variables, such as `max-w-[var(--container-xl)]`, `gap-[var(--grid-md)]`, and `py-[var(--layout-spacing-md)]`.
- Exact arbitrary values are allowed when the design reference requires a value that has no token yet. Prefer creating or reusing a token when the value is part of the design system.

Do not create external component stylesheet rules for ordinary layout, spacing, color, typography, border, radius, or responsive behavior when Tailwind utilities can express the design.

External CSS is reserved for:

- Tailwind and token infrastructure such as imports, `@theme`, and `@source`.
- Reusable Tailwind-native `@utility` abstractions.
- Complex effects that Tailwind cannot express clearly.

Do not invent BEM or semantic component class names for styling in Tailwind projects. Stable hook classes are allowed only when needed for behavior, testing, or third-party integration, and they must not carry styling responsibility.
