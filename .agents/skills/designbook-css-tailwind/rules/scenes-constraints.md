# Tailwind Scene Constraints

## `@source` Coverage

Tailwind's JIT compiler only scans files listed in `@source` directives. Scene YAML files are never included in `@source` — the core `scenes-constraints` rule enforces inline `style=""` for this reason.

When adding new component directories, ensure they are covered by an `@source` directive in the CSS entry point (see `component-source` rule). Scene files do not need coverage.
