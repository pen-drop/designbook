# Font Availability

A `font-*` utility may only be emitted when the font it resolves to is actually loadable. Using a typography utility whose underlying token is unresolved produces no error — the browser silently falls back to a serif/system font, and the compare stage cannot recover the lost typography. This rule makes that condition blocking instead of silent.

Before a component emits any `font-*` utility (e.g. a token-backed `font-heading`, `font-body`, or an arbitrary `font-[var(--font-…)]`):

- The `--font-*` token it maps to MUST resolve to a concrete family name. A token value that still contains an unresolved alias placeholder (a `{…}` segment) is not a family — it is a generation defect upstream.
- A matching `@font-face` declaration MUST exist for that family, or the family MUST be a generic/system family (`sans-serif`, `serif`, `monospace`, `system-ui`, …).

When neither holds, the font is unavailable. Treat that as a blocking defect of
the same weight as a missing component: leave the current task pending, append
the exact why to the execution [problems sidecar](../../designbook/resources/workflow-execution.md)
beside the plan, and continue other tasks — never mark the check passed via a
silent system-font fallback. The token and `@font-face` are owned by the
`css-generate` workflow; a missing self-hosted family is sourced from the design
reference's downloaded font binaries. When the sealed plan has no task that can
repair the face, record that ownership gap in the problems entry and keep going.
