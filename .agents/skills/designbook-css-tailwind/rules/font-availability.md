# Font Availability

A `font-*` utility may only be emitted when the font it resolves to is actually loadable. Using a typography utility whose underlying token is unresolved produces no error — the browser silently falls back to a serif/system font, and the compare stage cannot recover the lost typography. This rule makes that condition blocking instead of silent.

Before a component emits any `font-*` utility (e.g. a token-backed `font-heading`, `font-body`, or an arbitrary `font-[var(--font-…)]`):

- The `--font-*` token it maps to MUST resolve to a concrete family name. A token value that still contains an unresolved alias placeholder (a `{…}` segment) is not a family — it is a generation defect upstream.
- A matching `@font-face` declaration MUST exist for that family, or the family MUST be a generic/system family (`sans-serif`, `serif`, `monospace`, `system-ui`, …).

When neither holds, the font is unavailable. Do not emit the utility against the broken token and treat the situation as a blocking defect of the same weight as a missing component: surface it (so the run stops at this stage rather than shipping a fallback) and resolve the missing `@font-face`/token before continuing. The token and `@font-face` are owned by the `css-generate` workflow; a missing self-hosted family is sourced from the design reference's downloaded font binaries.
